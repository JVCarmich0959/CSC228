Facebook,0,"A lot of the stores mentioned previously were in the mall. The corporations went bankrupt or the stores didn’t have the business in Goldsboro.  Clayton is the fastest growing area in NC being that it is the area with land to expand outside Raleigh. Goldsboro can not support or afford what is available in other areas. It’s a proud agricultural community. Remember when you’re talking about new businesses, where we live and what this area can support (size of Goldsboro) also on line shopping kills the brick and mortar stores that was here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook,0,Just get it back to par!!! With new stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Facebook,0,"Due to online shopping with any and everything available brick and mortar businesses and malls are becoming a thing of the past unfortunately. The mall would be a great entrainment space though. Skating Rink, Family Game Center, indoor Trampoline, Escape room,  Painting and Krafts for Kids/Families, 1 hour photo studio, Massage,/Spa, Carousel, Small specialty Kiosks, and of course food, unique small food vendors. There is a diverse population here..bring the foods of the world. Not just chain food restaurants. The ideas are endless, just need the support from the county. Just like they are building up downtown Center st area they Mall is wasted prime local area close to the base and what Goldsboro needs. Friendly, fun, family or single people activities instead of people having drive out of town. Ijs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
