We went last night. I think all of the staff were such kind hearted people. They would do well with a little feedback to help the business out. The food was delicious. They need some reassessment on the business front. Great potential there.,positive,neutral
that will avoid my embarassed reaction of getting a table and leaving after just a round of sodas and single mochi ice cream divided with guest plus tip.. bit expensive for me currently,negative,negative

Well they have priced me out. I‚Äôll stick with my China King or Rice & Noodles,negative,negative
My guess would be that they average both prices and serve a smaller portion of each protein.,negative,neutral
Steak costs more than chicken and shrimp. If you‚Äôre cutting the steak in half it would be less pairing it with a cheaper meat maybe?,positve,neutral
The portion of steak is smaller with a combo‚Ä¶,positve,neutral
